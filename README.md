### Instructions:

In this project, build a copy a website:

You should recreate any buttons, navigation, images, forms, etc. that exist on your chosen website, but they do not need to function (Ex: a form does not need to actually submit any information, links don't need to go to another page, etc.). 

While we will mainly be focusing on the desktop view of your site, extra consideration will be given to sites that function and look accurate on mobile as well. -- Each person is responsible for one link on each page. Home / Courses / About Us / Etc. 

All files (HTML, CSS, images, fonts, etc) should be uploaded to a GitHub repo on your profile. Use GitHub collaboration tools to work on one group repository.
